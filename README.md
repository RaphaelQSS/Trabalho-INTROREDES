A basic group chat to learn how to use the Socket.io, using the languages: Typescript and javascript.
HTML and JS to make the front-end and TS to make the back-end.
The project has 3 group chats sorted by numbers, a field to enter a username, a field to write and send a message, and a simple view of the chat that shows the user and the message (Inspired by SMS)
